Vin Diesel Fuel is a freestyle bot in RL, it can't run without state setting enabled in RLBot.

To use it, edit the code of Vin Diesel Fuel's file "bot.py", in a few ways:
If you intend to record a shot, change the variable "self.mode" to "collect" and run the game with only player and Vin Diesel Fuel.
If you intend to replicate the shot, change the variable "self.mode" to "replay" and run the game with Vin Diesel Fuel (recommended team to be the same as the player when he/she did the shot).
